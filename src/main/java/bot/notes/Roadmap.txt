DISCUS BOTUS
============

IDEAS:
- !draw + [thing] - draws something using templates or MATH
- !turtle
- !randomNumberBenchmark
- split up commands into classes according to permission & whether they are
  threaded needed (so that in !info they can be auto-assigned(?))
- !help to get started (informs about !info & !commandList)
- end command with ! to specify command end / possible separate message start
- !demonstrate + [command] - demonstrates usage of a specified command
- automatically create DB Dev/Admin/Tester roles & assign Admin role to owner
- automatically assign Bots role to bots
- !goodbye - basically !yeet but without re-invitation
- !buildEmbed - build your own embed utilizing ListenerAdapter with staging


IMPLEMENTATIONS TODO:
TODO: !spam + [amount] + [interval]
TODO: !spam + ["on"/"off"] + [interval]
TODO: !spam + ["on"/"off"]
TODO: !harass + [name] + ["on"/"off"] + [interval]
TODO: !harass + [name] + ["on"/"off"]
TODO: proper documentation w/ javadoc
TODO: implement printing of what permission is needed for denied command
TODO: implement !permissions - prints what permissions user has / what
      commands they can use (!permissions + [username] for others?)
TODO: implement separate command lists (!adminCommandList, !devCommandList, etc.)
TODO: implement extra argument to all command lists, so that all lower-ranked
      commands are also listed (e.g. !debugCommandList + "+")
TODO: implement input restrictions field in info embed
TODO: change shutdown to threaded process so that it's stoppable ?
TODO: add "are you sure?" step to !shutdown

TODO: work out responsive command structure (when user is supposed to respond
      to something from the bot, which it then uses to respond again)
      TODO: make !stop remove ListenerAdapters of responsive commands

FIXES TODO:
TODO: let specific-stop interrupt multi-string named threads (e.g. "Harass Hades")
TODO: let !yeet be confirmed only by author
TODO: disable yeet if a yeet command is already in process/waiting for reply
TODO: improve command permission system
TODO: fix permission checker (won't let db dev use !yeet)

DONE TODAY:
- 11/08 - created Test & TestListenerAdapter to test responsive command structure
- 11/08 - linked Test with TestListenerAdapter
- 11/08 - added restart & shutdown function to TestListenerAdapter
- 11/08 - added complete 3-layer responsive dialog tree to !test
- 11/08 - renamed !test to !animals (includes corresponding ListenerAdapter)
